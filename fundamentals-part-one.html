      <h4>Preface</h4>
      <p>I was raised by the ocean, and sailing is by far my favorite way to experience the wind and waves. Some of the best days I’ve had out on the water have been with friends who have never sailed before, and I’ve come to cherish the opportunity to introduce people to the activity.</p>
      <p>That’s the simple reason I’m writing these. I want to help more people discover sailing. I want to share with everyone what I’ve learned over the years. And I sincerely hope that this tutorial is somebody’s first step towards the helm.</p>
      <p><em>Your appreciation is what pushes me to write more. If you like this lesson or have any stories to share, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/sailsonsails">find me on Twitter</a> and I’ll be thrilled to hear from you.</em></p>

      <h3>What Makes a Sailboat</h3>
      <p><em>“It’s out there at sea that you are really yourself.”<br/>– Vito Dumas</em></p>
      <p>The only thing more beautiful than a sailboat crossing a glistening bay under billowing white sails is the view from the boat itself. There’s a mindset of peacefulness and simplicity that takes over as a sailor gives her full attention to the wind.</p>

      <p>There are different types of sailboats for every style of sailing, and you may come to have a preference. If you sail casually, competitively, all around the world, in shallow waters, on lakes, or in windy bays, there are boats with the right layout, size, and shape for you.</p>
      <p>Nearly all sailboats share a few common features that make sailing possible. We’ll explore each one in this tutorial.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A <span class="vocab-word">mast</span>; a tall vertical pole that carries the sails high in the air.</li>
        <li>A <span class="vocab-word">boom</span>; a horizontal pole attached to the mast and bottom of the sail to control the angle and shape of the sail.</li>
        <li>A <span class="vocab-word">keel</span> or <span class="vocab-word">centerboard</span>; a fin running lengthwise under the water to help the boat move in the right direction.</li>
        <li>A <span class="vocab-word">rudder</span>; a moveable fin behind the keel that, when turned, turns the boat.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you take classes at a sailing school, you might start on a boat designed for learning, like a Hunter 17. If you make it out on the water with friends or as part of a crew, there’s no telling what you’ll end up on. Either way, ask questions — sailors love talking about their boats.</p>
      <p>In a later tutorial, I’ll include some tips on signing up for sailing lessons or finding a crew to join.</p>

      <h3>How Sails Work</h3>
      <p>Knowing how your sails work will be your most valuable skill. Once you understand the theory of how sails work, you will find the basics of sailing remarkably intuitive. And as you learn more about different boats and their features, you’ll discover more about the physics of sailing faster, safer, and further.</p>
      <p>The <span class="vocab-word">mainsail</span>, or principal sail on nearly all sailboats, is connected to the <em>mast</em> by its <span class="vocab-word">luff</span>, or frontmost edge. Its <span class="vocab-word">foot</span>, or bottom edge, is attached horizontally to the <em>boom</em>. The result is a triangular sail that can be rotated by <span class="vocab-word">trimming</span>, or adjusting the position of the <em>boom</em>.</p>
      <hr class="hr">
      <h4 class="gray text-center">Hold your thumb and index finger in an L shape. Your index finger is the mast while your thumb is the boom. Rotating your hand at your wrist is similar to the act of trimming your sails.</h4>

      <h4>Windward and Leeward</h4>
      <p>To begin to understand how your sails work, it’s valuable to know the sailing terms <span class="vocab-word">windward</span> and <span class="vocab-word">leeward</span>.</p>
      <p>The windward side of your sail is the side closest to the origin of the wind. The side opposite the origin of the wind is the leeward (pronounced loo’ard) side.</p>
      <hr class="hr">
      <h4 class="gray text-center">To demonstrate this, blow on your palm. Your palm is the windward side of your hand and the back of your hand is the leeward side. It’s that simple. If you flip your hand and try again, your palm is now to leeward.</h4>
      <hr class="hr">

      <h4>Push and Lift</h4>
      <p>Modern sails are designed to create two types of power — push from the wind hitting the windward side of the sail and lift from the wind rushing along the leeward side.</p>
      <p>Windward push is intuitive. You can feel it on a gusty day or see it when a breeze carries leaves around the yard. The wind hits you and you move with it.</p>
      <p>The second is a little tricky and isn’t as easy to see around you. It is the lift, or pull, created when the wind rushes along the leeward side of the sail faster than it does along the windward side.</p>
      <hr class="hr">
      <h4 class="gray text-center">If you put your hand out the window of a moving car like an airplane wing, you’ve felt lift.</h4>
      <hr class="hr">
      <p>This lift is made possible by the curvature of the sail. You will see that sails aren’t cut flat, but rounded to gradually bend the path of the wind. When the wind splits at the <em>luff</em>, or leading edge, of the sail to both the windward and leeward sides, the curve forces the leeward wind to speed up. This creates a suction that pulls the boat boat forward.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="eight columns offset-by-two">
      <p>The art and science of sailing towards or across the wind begins with windward push and leeward lift working together.</p>
      <p>When the sail is trimmed, or positioned, just right, the windward breeze pushes the boat and fills the sail to create a smooth curve along the leeward side. At the same time, the wind rushes along the leeward side, creating lift that pulls the boat forward.</p>
      <p>It follows that if there’s not enough wind to fill the sail from the windward side, the sails won’t work. They’ll flap in the breeze like a flag.</p>

      <h3>The Keel and Rudder</h3>
      <p>Now that you know how your sails create power, it’s time to learn about the parts of the boat responsible for making sure you move in the right direction.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="article-image">

  <div class="container">
    <div class="eight columns offset-by-two">
      <h4>The Keel</h4>
      <p>When sails are perfectly trimmed, they still generate a considerable amount of power to leeward, which makes the boat want to drift downwind. The keel resists this drift and allows the boat to travel in a straight line with little no leeway.</p>
      <hr class="hr">
      <h4 class="gray text-center">Imagine the wind coming from 12 o’clock and your boat is pointed at 9. Your sails generate power towards 7 or 8, but thanks to the lateral resistance from the keel, you’re moving straight towards 9 o’clock with little to no leeway.</h4>
      <hr class="hr">
      <p>All sailboats, from sporty dinghies to 70-foot yachts, rely on the lateral resistance of keels, centerboards, daggerboards, or leeboards. They can be fixed in place and extremely heavy or light and adjustable. And in many cases, a weighted keel provides stability that keeps boats from capsizing.</p>
      <h4>The Rudder</h4>
      <p>The rudder is a fin at the rearmost end of the boat — sometimes an extension of the keel itself — that rotates to turn the boat. By rotating the rudder diagonally to the right, the boat will turn to the right, and vice versa.</p>
      <p>There are two main types of steering on sailboats — with a <span class="vocab-word">wheel</span> or <span class="vocab-word">tiller</span>. Just like in a car, the wheel will turn the boat in the direction you turn it by angling the rudder to the right. Alternatively, a tiller is a handle connected to the top of the rudder, and is controlled oppositely. By pulling the tiller towards the left, the rudder will be angled to the right, which turns the boat to the right.</p>
