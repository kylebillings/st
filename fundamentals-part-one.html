    <h2>Learn to sail: Part I</h2>
    <label>Part I of X</label>

    <p>Welcome to your first glimpse into the world of sailing. This tutorial will get you started with three fundamentals to bring with you on your next sail — which could be your first.</p>

    <p>First, you’ll learn about why sailors sail — the feeling, the lifestyle, and the community.</p>

    <p>Second, you’ll learn about how sailors work with the wind to travel anywhere they wish.</p>

    <p>Finally, you’ll learn about what it’s like to join a crew and do your part on the boat.</p>

    <p>If you’re just beginning, I can’t tell you how much fun you’re about to have. Enjoy!</p>

    <h3>To love sailing.</h3>

    <p>Some of my favorite sailing memories are of my friends on their very first time out on the water. Without fail, everyone we brought on board found something to get excited about. The gorgeous views, the rise and fall of the waves, the radar and autopilot systems, the sun, the splash. I am absolutely sure that you will find something you love, too. Here are a few reasons to be excited.</p>

    <h4>Sailing builds incredible friendships.</h4>

    <p>The sailing community is welcoming and full of hardworking people who make the most of leisure. Sailing friendships are formed in close quarters and built on trust and communication. </p>

    <h4>Sailing is never the same twice.</h4>

    <p>On some days, you’ll be soaked by the waves crashing against your boat, and on others, you’ll be chatting with friends and waiting for a breeze. Sailing will always give you something new.</p>

    <h4>Sailing is mindful.</h4>

    <p>When you’re out on the water — at the whim of the wind — your mind will find a reason to relax. The stress of daily distractions have no place in the rhythm of sailing. It is genuinely meditative.</p>

    <h3>The boat.</h3>

    <p>[in progress] Most of today’s sailboats can travel at <em>nearly</em> any angle to the direction of the wind by . With the right course and sail trim, you can sail in any direction except directly towards it. If you stick your hand out the window of a car, you’ll feel your hand pulled or pushed up and down. That’s how sails work. </p>

    <h3>The wind.</h3>

    <p>Sailing is a dance with the wind. For every shift in its strength or direction, a sailor changes her <span class="vocab-word">course</span>  (direction) or <span class="vocab-word">sail trim</span> (adjustment or position) in response. Stand outside and feel how the wind blows past you in puffs and ruffles the trees. That is the fuel of a sailboat and you will learn how to step with it in time. </p>

    <h3>The physics of sailing.</h3>

    <p>[in progress: trying to come up with a new way to teach points of sail.]</p>

    <h3>Points of sail.</h3>

    <p>Each <span class="vocab-word">point of sail</span> has a name and specific characteristics. You’ll learn them in the next section.</p>

    <h4>Point of Sail I: In Irons</h4>

    <p>Let’s begin with the one direction you <em>can’t</em> sail — directly into the wind. Sailors call this point of sail <span class="vocab-word">in irons</span>. If your boat is in irons, your sail will flap like a flag and you won’t </p>

    <p>In Irons, or <span class="vocab-word">luffing</span>, is actually a very useful point of sail. For example, a sailor aims her bow directly into the wind to safely raise her sails and even to slow herself down at docks, moorings, or to save a man overboard. </p>

    <h4>Point 2: Close-Hauled</h4>

    <p>Let’s start moving. The closest point of sail to the oncoming wind is at a 45º angle to either side. This is known as <span class="vocab-word">close-hauled</span>. To sail this close to the wind, a sailor trims, or tightens, her sails </p>

  </div>

  <div class="container typography-container">

    <p>Sailing close-hauled is thrilling. Sailors love how fast it feels. At this point of sail, there is a lot of pressure on the sail, which causes the boat to lean, or heel, over. </p>

    <p class="bonus">Bonus: when a sailboat heels over, the surface area of the sails is reduced. One way to impress your skipper — and to enjoy one of the best views from a sailboat — is to move to the high side of the boat and hang your feet off the edge. That will even out the boat just a little bit and give your sails just a little bit more power.</p>

    <h4>Point <em>N</em>: Running</h4>

    <p>Still working on this.</p>
