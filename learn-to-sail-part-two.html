      <h3>The Magic of Sailing</h3>
      <p><em>“When I go sailing I like to move around to different parts of a boat. The perspective always changes. From the bow it’s noisy and purposeful, from the leeward rail the boat seems fast, from the cockpit the atmosphere is quiet and thoughtful, and from the masthead it’s exciting to take in the view.”<br/>– Gary Jobson</em></p>
      <p>The freedom of sailing is in going where you want to go, but the beauty is in your relationship with the weather along the way. The wind and water give you permission to sail, and you will find nothing more important — or enjoyable — than the constant job of keeping the boat moving.</p>
      <p>Sailing is like dancing with the wind. For every shift in the wind’s strength or direction, a sailor changes her course (direction) or sail trim (adjustment or position) in response.</p>
      <p>A sailor must always be aware of where the wind is coming from, because if you don’t know the direction of the wind, you won’t be able to choose a direction of your own.</p>

      <h3>Watching the Wind</h3>
      <p>It can be a challenge to keep track of the wind at first. It constantly shifts in speed and direction, and it’s mostly invisible. But the signs do become more obvious with practice — the ripples on the water, other boats, flags, or simply the feel of the breeze.</p>
      <p>Most sailboats have <span class="vocab-word">weathervanes</span> onboard that rotate and point at the direction of the oncoming wind. Some have digital indicators showing the exact wind direction relative to the boat’s course. In the absence of a weathervane, a sailor can check the wind direction by looking towards the wind and listening for the wind to pass by both of her ears.</p>

      <h3>Controlling the Sails</h3>
      <p><span class="vocab-word">Rigging</span> refers to the system of ropes and cables aboard a sailboat. There are two main types — standing rigging and running rigging.</p>
      <p><span class="vocab-word">Standing rigging</span> refers to the predominantly stationary system of sturdy metal cables that connect the hull and mast for additional support.</p>
      <p><span class="vocab-word">Running rigging</span> is the system of <span class="vocab-word">lines</span>, or ropes, that sailors use to meticulously adjust the shape of their sails, from the overall angle to the tension of individual sections of the sail.</p>

      <h4>Sheets</h4>
      <p>For now, it’s important to recognize at least one part of the running rigging — the <span class="vocab-word">sheets</span>.</p>
      <p>A <span class="vocab-word">sheet</span> is any line on the boat that controls the shape or angle of a sail. As with nearly all equipment on a boat, there are specific names for every sheet. For now, we’ll focus on the sheet that controls the angle of the boom and mainsail, aptly known as the <span class="vocab-word">mainsheet</span>.</p>
      <p>The mainsheet simply controls the amount of slack on the boom. Letting the mainsheet out lets the wind push the boom further out, while pulling it in forces the sail to stay in place.</p>
      <p>The mainsheet generally runs through a <span class="vocab-word">block</span>, or pulley, that makes it easier to adjust a sail even with wind pounding against it. This block often has a <span class="vocab-word">cleat</span> that locks the mainsheet in place, so the sailor can take a break.</p>
      <p>Using the mainsheet is the most fundamental part of trimming a sail.</p>

      <h4>Sail Trim</h4>
      <p><span class="vocab-word">Sail trim</span> refers to the set shape of a sail, which sailors can adjust in countless ways to perfectly respond to the wind. To put it very simply, to trim a sail is to pull the boom to windward with the mainsheet and hold it at the correct angle so that the curve of the sail bends the wind around the windward and leeward sides.</p>
      <p>If the boom is let out too far, there won’t be enough pressure against the windward side of the sail, and the curve will collapse. This is called <span class="vocab-word">luffing</span> and it’s clear when it’s happening — the sail will start to flap like a flag.</p>
      <p>If the boom is sheeted in too tight, the angle of the sail will be too sharp and the wind won’t bend along the leeward side of the sail. This is known as <span class="vocab-word">stalling</span>. It’s not as easy to tell when a sail is stalled, so there’s a popular technique that sailors use to make sure a sail is trimmed just right.</p>

      <p>The right amount of trim is just enough so the sail doesn’t luff. Letting the sail out until it luffs and then trimming it back in is a classic trick to maintain perfect trim.</p>

      <h3>Points of Sail</h3>
      <p>A <span class="vocab-word">point of sail</span> refers to a sailboat’s direction in relation to wind direction. Each point of sail has a name, general procedures for maintaining proper sail trim, and a distinctive feel.</p>
      <p>Since a point of sail is determined by the direction of the wind, it changes whenever the wind shifts or the boat turns. Making the most of the wind means paying close attention to the wind as it relates to the boat and keeping the sail working efficiently at all times.</p>

      <h4>In Irons</h4>
      <p>Let’s begin with the one direction you can’t sail — directly into the wind. Sailors call this point of sail <span class="vocab-word">in irons</span>. If a boat is in irons, its sail will luff completely and it won’t be able to move.</p>
      <p>Getting caught in irons can be frustrating, but luffing is actually a very useful technique. For example, pointing directly into the wind de-powers the sail, which is necessary when raising the sail or making certain adjustments to its trim. As well, luffing is like hitting the breaks, which sailors use to approach a dock or rescue a man overboard.</p>

      <h4>Running</h4>
      <p>Sailing with the wind coming directly from behind is known as a <span class="vocab-word">run</span> or <span class="vocab-word">running</span>. At this point of sail, a sailor uses the mainsheet to ease the sail to be perpendicular the oncoming wind, such that all of the boat’s drive is coming from the wind pushing against the windward side of the sail. This means there is no leeward lift.</p>
      <p>As simple as it sounds, running is one of the more touchy points of sail. The combination of wind and waves can cause the boat to steer itself and roll side-to-side, which consistently makes people seasick. As well, if the wind shifts and connects with the leeward side of the sail, the boom can quickly and dangerously swing across the cockpit. Just watch the sails and keep your head down at a run, and you’ll be just fine.</p>
      <p>If your destination is directly downwind, a run will get you there. But many sailors prefer sailing on a safer point of sail.</p>

      <h4>Broad Reach</h4>
      <p>At a <span class="vocab-word">broad reach</span>, the boat is sailing at about 45º to either side of a downwind run. The sails are again eased to be perpendicular to the wind coming from behind (astern).</p>
      <p>Many of the troublesome aspects of sailing at a run are solved at a broad reach. The chances of a wind shift swinging the boom across the deck is reduced, the sea-sickening swaying stops, and the sails start generating a small amount of lift, which makes it a faster course than a pure run.</p>

      <h4>Beam Reach</h4>
      <p>Sailing perpendicular to the oncoming wind is known as a <span class="vocab-word">beam reach</span>. To sail at a beam reach, the sail should be eased out about halfway, such that the curve of the sail bends the wind about 45º.</p>
      <p>At this point of sail, the sail harnesses the most of both push and lift, and the drive from the sails is directed as close as possible to the bow of the boat. Resultantly, a beam reach is the fastest point of sail in most conditions.</p>

      <h4>Close Reach</h4>
      <p>Pointing about 20º higher towards the wind than a beam reach is known as a <span class="vocab-word">close reach</span>. Many of the same principles apply to a close reach as do a beam reach, though the sail must be trimmed in slightly to maintain a correct angle to the wind.</p>

      <h4><em>Heeling</em></h4>
      <p><em>As the boat points higher into the wind, the resulting drive from the sail is directed more towards the side of the boat. The keel works hard to counteract the sideways motion, but the boat tends to tip, or heel, to leeward as a result.</em></p>
      <p><em>On larger boats, the keel is heavy enough to keep the boat from capsizing, so you have nothing to worry about. It’s actually a lot of fun when it happens. Dipping the rail is a windy day challenge of putting the edges of the deck underwater.</em></p>
      <p><em>On dinghies, like the Laser, there’s no significant weight in the daggerboard to keep the boat upright. It’s up to the sailor to balance the boat, which often means hiking, or hanging off the windward side of the boat, which is personally my absolute favorite thing to do.</em></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Section -->
  <div class="container">
    <div class="eight columns offset-by-two">
      <h4>Close Hauled</h4>
      <p>The highest possible point of sail is at a 45º angle to either side of the oncoming wind. This is known as <span class="vocab-word">close hauled</span>. To sail this close to the wind, the sail is trimmed as close to the centerline of the boat as possible.</p>
      <p>When close hauled, pointing any higher into the wind will cause the sail to luff, because the windward side of the sail is no longer full enough to maintain its shape, and it can’t be trimmed in any further. This un-sailable area is known as the <span class="vocab-word">no sail zone</span>.</p>
      <p>The main distinction between a close haul and a close reach is that, when close hauled, the wind can directly affect the boat’s direction. If the wind shifts towards the bow of the boat, the sails luff and the sailor needs to turn downwind to keep moving. Alternatively, if at a close reach, the sail can be trimmed in to keep it full and the boat can maintain its course.</p>
      <p>Sailing close-hauled is thrilling. There is a lot of pressure heeling the boat over, so much that a sailor can be standing on the side of the seats in the cockpit. Sailing towards the wind usually means splashing against the waves as well.</p>
      <p><em>When a sailboat heels over, the surface area of the sails is reduced. One way to impress your skipper — and to enjoy one of the best views from a sailboat — is to move to the high side of the boat and hang your feet off the edge. That will even out the boat just a little bit and give your sails just a little bit more power.</em></p>
